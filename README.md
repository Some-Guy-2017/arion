# Arion

Arion is a spaced repetition flashcard application for memorizing content over long periods of time.
It lets users create, manage, and study lists of flashcards.
This program is intended for language learners and students.
When learning a language, some vocabulary can appear infrequently and be hard to ever learn.
By using a spaced repetition system, learners can artificially increase the frequency of the vocabulary
to solidify their memory.
Students can use spaced repetition to learn concepts for their classes, so they can remember it for
exams, or once they have completed their course.
