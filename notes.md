# TODO
# Formatting the code
[ ] Remove test functions
[ ] Remove Flashcard.toString
[ ] Remove Flashcard.equals
[ ] Remove any extra main methods

## Done
[âœ“] make RANDOM_WORD_COUNT in ArionUtils final again
[âœ“] Reread
    [âœ“] Add inline comments
[âœ“] Change the Guide's about image to an actual image of the About window (not Lena ðŸ˜­)

[âœ“] Remove test hooks
[âœ“] Add inline comments

    [âœ“] Methods
        [âœ“] All methods have a block comment summarizing: Purpose, Input and Output
        [-] Some complex methods have explanatory comments inside
[âœ“] Format code
[âœ“] Add tests for all public methods
[âœ“] Figure out how to implement the features required by the rubric:
    [âœ“] Sequential Search: When studying finding cards due today
    [âœ“] Binary Search: When adding, maintain the sorted order
    [-] Casting datatypes (??)
    [âœ“] ArrayList: Flashcards array
    [-] Stack (maybe)
    [âœ“] Queue: Used to store the due cards
    [âœ“] Abstract Class & Method Overloading: Different kinds of flashcards
        - Simple Flashcard
        - Single select (radio buttons)
        - Multi-select & check (check boxes)
[âœ“] Write pseudocode
    [âœ“] Ensure menu callbacks are considered
        [âœ“] Include the Browse feature
    [âœ“] Include ArionDisplay.displayConfirmationWindow
[âœ“] Change sequence diagrams:
    [-] Add flashcard.toStringArray and flashcard.fromStringArray
    [âœ“] Change the class diagram:
        [âœ“] Remove Guide classes
            [âœ“] Change Guide sequence diagram to reflect this
        [âœ“] Add parseGuide
        [-] ArionDisplay includes displayConfirmationWindow
        [-] Flashcard includes fromStringArray
            [-] Edit sequence diagram
            [-] Add sequence diagram
        [âœ“] ArionDisplay includes displayMessage
            [âœ“] Study sequence diagram
        [âœ“] Remove updateReviewedCard
        [âœ“] Make review date & review interval public
        [âœ“] Add quit function to ArionDisplay
    [-] Double check that text matches sequence diagrams
    [-] Change Save, Load, and Delete so their overwriting confirmation includes display.displayConfirmationWindow
[ ] Actually implement test cases for existing methods
    [âœ“] ArionDisplay.java
    [âœ“] Database.java
        [âœ“] Change ArionTests.java deleteTestCase so it also checks the resulting flashcards are correct (maybe add unique flashcards)
    [âœ“] Arion.java
    [ ] Flashcard.java
    [ ] Refactor so tests use Test abstract class
[âœ“] Add text to all thrown exceptions
    [âœ“] ArionDisplay.java
    [âœ“] Flashcard.java
    [âœ“] Database.java
    [âœ“] Arion.java
[âœ“] Main Screen
    [âœ“] Clean up the code a little
        - Rename "makeDisplayReady" if possible
        - Move the code for setting up the JLabel header into a distinct function
            (like generateHeader or something, there should be a header for each screen)
    [âœ“] Implement the button callbacks
    [-] Use a 'displayElement' class to denote different kinds of elements:
        - ONLY DO THIS if there end up being many kinds of elements (more than header & paragraph)
        - enum for kind of element (paragraph, header, etc.)
        - font size
        - JComponent
        - this may be doable using just an enum that gets passed around with the actual component
[âœ“] Browse (not including delete & edit)
    [âœ“] Make adding the 'content' sub-panel to the main panel cleaner (setting the maximum size is not clean)
    [âœ“] Add buttons next to entries
[âœ“] Add
    [âœ“] Fix displayAddScreen so the text fields aren't so large
[âœ“] Save
    [âœ“] User confirmation
[âœ“] Load
    [âœ“] User confirmation
    - Wait until Save and Add features is completed
[âœ“] Delete
    [âœ“] User confirmation
[âœ“] Edit
[âœ“] Study
    [âœ“] Use Queue
[âœ“] Sort
    [âœ“] Make combo box sizes the same
[âœ“] Quit
[âœ“] Guide
    [âœ“] Make the text area not have to scroll horizontally
    [-] Use a real pop-up window, rather than this thing that cannot be dragged around (maybe another frame?).
    [âœ“] Add images into guide rendering
    [âœ“] Make generation of Guide panel generic (i.e. No predefined width / height)
    [âœ“] Make the buttons not clip into the bottom
    [âœ“] Fix all the image sizes
    [âœ“] Make pair consider image width when deciding sizes
    [âœ“] Make text parsing not consider white space
    [âœ“] Set JTextArea height to its actual size
    [âœ“] Write the guide
[âœ“] Press space to flip the flashcard
[âœ“] About
    [âœ“] What is SRS?
    [âœ“] Who uses it?
    [âœ“] How was Arion developed?
[âœ“] Ensure that window and pop up is not hard coded (pop up size should be relative to window size)
[âœ“] Add back buttons

# Testing

## Unit Testing
- Tests the smallest unit:
    - Classes
    - Methods
    - Data structures
- Uses test cases to test:
    - Valid: expected conditions
    - Invalid: unexpected data
- Documented in Unit Test Reports:
    - Prepared in tables
    - Headings:
        - Unit being tested
        - Test case
        - Expected Results
        - Returned Results:
            - Accurate output
            - Inaccurate output
            - User prompts to clarify input
            - Errors
            - Crashes
        - Status of Solution

## System Testing
- Tests that the software system **as a whole**:
    - Is error-free
    - Meets the requirements
    - Has seamless integration
    - Is robust
- System testing is performed similarly to unit testing
- Black-box testing
